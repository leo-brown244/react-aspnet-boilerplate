# react-dot-net
A starting point for building universal/isomorphin react applications with ASP.NET Core 1, leveraging existing front-end approaches. Uses the [JavaScriptViewEngine](https://github.com/pauldotknopf/javascriptviewengine).

## Goals

1. Minimize .NET's usage - It's only usage should be for building REST endpoints (WebApi) and providing the initial state (pure POCO). No razor syntax *anywhere*.
2. Client and server should render using the same files (javascript).

This approach is great for front-end developers because it gives them complete control to build their app as they like. No .NET crutches (bundling/razor). No opinions. No gotchyas.

## In a nut shell
